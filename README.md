# 🧪 Sergio Mathurin

Computer scientist. Data scientist.  
CTO at **[armsai.net](https://armsai.net)** where we build **AI-powered risk assessment** systems and try very hard not to ship garbage.

I like fast code, weird problems, and systems that shouldn’t work but do.

---

## TL;DR

- 💼 **CTO @ [armsai.net](https://armsai.net)** – leading a small team building **AI risk models** that people actually use  
- 🧠 Background in **CS + data science**  
- 🤓 **All-around CS nerd** with **shiny object syndrome** for anything interesting:
  - high performance computing  
  - edge / distributed systems  
  - game dev / simulation  
  - basically anything that melts CPUs or GPUs in a fun way

## What I Actually Do

Most days look like some mix of:

- Turning **noisy real-world data** into **risk scores** that people can make decisions with  
- Designing systems where:
  - data → models → APIs → dashboards → alerts  
  and the whole thing doesn’t collapse under load  
- Stress-testing models until they fail in entertaining ways, then fixing that  
- Context-switching between:
  - ML experiments  
  - system architecture  
  - reviewing PRs  
  - “so… what happens if this node dies?” conversations  

I care a lot about:

- **Latency, reliability, and observability**
- **Evaluations that mean something**
- Code that’s boring to operate and fun to extend

## Shiny Object Syndrome: CS Edition

I hop between:

- ⚡ **High Performance Computing**  
  Hand-tuned code, vectorization, caches, profiling, the whole rabbit hole.

- 🌐 **Distributed & edge stuff**  
  Many machines, flaky networks, partial failures, weird topologies.

- 🎮 **Game dev / simulation**  
  Real-time loops, ECS-style architectures, physics-ish things, “it runs at 240 FPS now” joy.

- 🧵 **Concurrency & parallelism**  
  Threads, async, queues, locks, lock-free, “why is this deadlocked?” at 2AM.

If it’s low-level, high-throughput, or just slightly cursed, I’m probably interested.

## Tools I Reach For

This isn’t the full list, but a vibe check:

- **Languages:** Python, a bit of low-level when necessary  
- **ML stack:** PyTorch / TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas  
- **Infra / systems:** APIs, microservices, containers, CI/CD, logging, tracing  
- **Data:** SQL, NoSQL, queues, streams – whatever makes sense for the problem  

Tech changes all the time. What doesn’t:

- Measure it  
- Ship it  
- Keep it debuggable  

---

## What You’ll See on This GitHub

- Prototypes around **risk modeling**, **ML**, and **systems**
- Little utilities that made my life easier and might make yours easier too
- Side quests in:
  - performance experiments  
  - distributed toys  
  - game / simulation experiments  

Some repos are clean. Some are “notes to my future self.” Both are honest.

## If You’re a Recruiter / Founder / Human

Things I’m good at:

- Owning a problem end-to-end: from idea → data → model → production  
- Making **ML systems production-grade**, not just “Jupyter-grade”  
- Designing and debugging **distributed / high-load** systems  
- Picking up new tools fast and dropping them even faster if they suck  

Things I’m interested in:

- Hard technical problems with real impact  
- Risk, uncertainty, simulation, optimization, systems at scale  
- Teams that actually care about engineering quality, not just slides
