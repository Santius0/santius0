# 🧪 Sergio Mathurin

Computer scientist • Data scientist • All-around CS nerd  
CTO at **[armsai.net](https://armsai.net)** – we build **AI-powered risk assessment** and try not to ship trash.  
CS Instructor at **The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine** – specialising in **AI** and **Big Data**.

I like fast code, weird systems, and models that survive the real world.

## What I’m Into

Shiny object syndrome, CS edition:

- ⚡ **High performance computing** – squeezing hardware until it squeals  
- 🌐 **Distributed / edge computing** – many machines, unreliable networks, still has to work  
- 🎮 **Game dev / simulation** – real-time loops, ECS vibes, “why is this frame time spiking”  
- 🧵 **Concurrency / parallelism** – threads, async, queues, and occasional deadlocks  

Basically: if it’s fast, low-level, or slightly cursed, I’m interested.

## What I Actually Do

- Turn **messy, noisy data** into **risk scores** people can act on  
- Design pipelines: data → models → APIs → dashboards → alerts  
- Make ML systems **observable, testable, and not a nightmare to operate**  
- Jump between architecture, ML experiments, and production firefights

Tech stack changes. Principles don’t:  
**measure it, ship it, keep it debuggable.**
