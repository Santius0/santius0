# 👋 Hey, I’m Sergio

**Computer Scientist** · **Data Scientist** · **CTO @ [armsai.net](https://armsai.net)**  
Building **AI-powered risk assessment** systems with a small team that punches way above its weight.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧠 Design and ship **machine learning** / **AI** systems for real-world risk problems  
- 🏗️ Architect end-to-end pipelines: data → models → APIs → dashboards  
- 🔍 Obsess over **data quality**, **evaluation**, and **failure modes** (because “it works on my machine” is not a metric)  
- 🤝 Lead a small team of engineers & scientists as **CTO**, balancing research doomscrolling with actually shipping things  

---

## 🛠️ Stuff I Work With

**Core interests**

- Applied **ML / DL**
- **Risk modeling** & decision systems
- **MLOps** / deployment / monitoring
- **Data engineering** for messy real-world signals

**Typical toolbox** (non-exhaustive, in no particular order):

- Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch / TensorFlow)
- APIs, microservices, and glue code to make it all talk
- Experiment tracking, model versioning, dashboards, logging

> I care less about the exact framework and more about:  
> **Can we measure it? Can we trust it? Can we maintain it?**

## 🧪 Current Focus @ armsai.net

At **[armsai.net](https://armsai.net)** we’re building **AI-powered risk assessment** systems, with a focus on:

- Turning noisy data into **actionable risk scores**
- Making models **interpretable enough** for people who actually have to rely on them
- Tight feedback loops between **domain experts** and **ML systems**

Small team, big surface area.

---

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

- Experiments and prototypes around **risk modeling** and **AI**
- Utilities and patterns I reuse across projects
- Occasional “this should be a library, not a snippet” repos

Expect code that’s:
- Practical > cute  
- Measurable > magical

> I like systems where **data, models, and humans** all inform each other.  
> If your problem involves risk, uncertainty, and ugly real-world data, we’ll probably have a lot to talk about.
